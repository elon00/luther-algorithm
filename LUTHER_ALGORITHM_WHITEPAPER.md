## Introduction

### Background and Motivation

The advent of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current cryptographic systems. Shor's algorithm [1] can efficiently factor large numbers, breaking RSA and similar public-key cryptosystems, while Grover's algorithm [2] reduces the effective key length of symmetric encryption by half. Traditional cryptographic systems are becoming increasingly vulnerable as quantum computing technology advances.

Luther's Algorithm addresses these challenges by implementing a hybrid approach that combines:
- **Classical cryptography** for performance
- **Quantum-resistant algorithms** for future-proofing
- **Post-quantum cryptography** for immediate security
- **Adaptive intelligence** for optimal performance

### Key Contributions

1. **Multi-layer Security Architecture**: Triple-layered encryption with independent security mechanisms
2. **Quantum-Resistant Key Derivation**: Novel approach using parallel quantum factoring
3. **Adaptive Algorithm Selection**: Dynamic choice of optimal cryptographic primitives
4. **Post-Quantum Integration**: Seamless incorporation of lattice-based cryptography
5. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel processing and hardware acceleration

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent security layers
2. **Adaptive Security**: Dynamic algorithm selection based on context

## Algorithm Architecture

### 1. Adaptive Selection Engine

The algorithm employs an intelligent selection mechanism that analyzes input characteristics:

```python
def _select_mode(self, data_size, context):
    """
    Adaptive algorithm selection based on data characteristics
    """
    if data_size < 1024:  # < 1KB
        return 'classical'
    elif data_size > 10**6:  # > 1MB
        return 'super'
    else:  # 1KB - 1MB
        return 'hybrid'
```

### 2. Multi-Layer Encryption Framework

    """

    """
    if n < 2**10:
        return [n]

    factors = []
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=os.cpu_count()) as exe:
        for i in exe.map(
            lambda x: [x, n//x] if n % x == 0 else None,
            range(2, int(np.sqrt(n)) + 1)
        ):
            if i:
                factors.extend(i)
                break

    return sorted(factors)
