   ```

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Keep functions focused and modular

- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Run quality checks**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   python -m pytest

   # Check code style
   black .
   flake8 .

   # Type checking
   mypy luthers_algorithm.py
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
