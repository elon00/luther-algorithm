## 1. Protocol Overview

Alpenglow represents a significant advancement over Solana's current TowerBFT consensus:

### Core Components:
1. **Votor**: Dual-path consensus with 80% fast finalization or 60% conservative finalization
2. **Rotor**: Erasure-coded block propagation with stake-weighted relay sampling
3. **20+20 Resilience**: Tolerates up to 20% Byzantine nodes + 20% crashed/offline nodes

### Performance Claims:
- 100-150ms finalization (100x faster than current)
- Single-hop block propagation
- Dual-path finalization for optimal latency

## 2. Formal Methodology

### Tools Used:
- **TLA+**: For formal specification and model checking
- **TLC**: For exhaustive verification of finite models
- **PlusCal**: For algorithmic components

### Verification Approach:
1. **Abstract Modeling**: Created mathematical abstractions of protocol components
2. **Invariant Proofs**: Proved safety properties as TLA+ invariants
3. **Temporal Logic**: Used TLA+ temporal operators for liveness properties
4. **Model Checking**: Exhaustive verification for small configurations
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Verified properties under various failure scenarios

## 3. Votor Formal Specification

### 3.1 Dual-Path Voting Logic

```tla
Votor_FastPathProperty ==
    \A s \in 1..10 :
        certificates[s] = "fast_cert" =>
            LET fast_voters == {v \in 1..NumValidators : votes[s][v] = "fast_vote"}
            IN StakeThreshold(fast_voters, 80)

Votor_SlowPathProperty ==
    \A s \in 1..NumValidators :
        certificates[s] = "slow_cert" =>
            LET slow_voters == {v \in 1..NumValidators : votes[s][v] = "slow_vote"}
            IN StakeThreshold(slow_voters, 60) /\ ~StakeThreshold(slow_voters, 80)
```

### 3.2 Certificate Generation

**Fast Certificate (80% stake):**
- Generated when ≥80% stake votes for fast finalization
- Enables immediate block finalization
- Requires good network conditions

**Slow Certificate (60% stake):**
- Generated when ≥60% stake votes for conservative finalization
- Used when fast path unavailable
- Provides safety under degraded conditions

**Skip Certificate:**
- Generated when neither fast nor slow paths available
- Implements timeout mechanism
- Prevents indefinite blocking

### 3.3 Verified Properties

✅ **Certificate Uniqueness**: No slot has multiple certificates
✅ **Fast Path Correctness**: 80% stake enables fast finalization
✅ **Slow Path Correctness**: 60% stake enables conservative finalization
✅ **Progress Guarantee**: Certificates eventually generated with >60% honest stake

                total_relay_stake == StakeOf(relays)
            IN (total_relay_stake * 100) \div TotalStake >= 60
```
